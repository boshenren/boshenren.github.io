## Survey and Evaluation of Grassland Resources in Southern Mountains of China  
**2022.05 - 2024.05**  
*Member*, funded by Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Class A)  
- Participated in a comprehensive survey of grassland resources in the southern mountainous regions of China.  
- Utilized remote sensing techniques and field surveys to assess grassland conditions and biodiversity.  

## Vegetation and Plant Diversity Monitoring Network in Shennongjia National Park, China  
**2022.09 - 2025.08**  
*Core Researcher*, funded by Local Project for Shennongjia National Park, Hubei Province, China  
- Participated in establishing and surveying a 25-hectare forest plot, altitudinal gradient plots, and wetland meadow community quadrats in Dajiu Lake.  
- Utilized UAV to acquire hyperspectral, multispectral, LiDAR, and thermal infrared remote sensing data for the 25-hectare forest plot, followed by data processing and analysis.  
- Coordinated field data collection efforts to ensure high-quality long-term monitoring data.  
- Analyzed plant community structure, diversity, and their relationships with ecosystem functions to provide a scientific basis for biodiversity conservation strategies.  

## Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of Subalpine Peatland Wetland Vegetation  
**2023.06 - Present**  
*Master's Research*, Thesis: "Plant Diversity Patterns and Seasonal Dynamics in Dajiu Lake Wetland Based on UAV Remote Sensing"  
- Conducted multi-scale (leaf, canopy, UAV) plant spectral characteristic analysis and functional trait retrieval in subalpine peatland wetlands.  
- Investigated the relationship between plant diversity and spectral diversity in peatland ecosystems, exploring influencing factors.  
- Developed classification and mapping methods for dominant wetland species using hyper/multi-spectral data specific to subalpine peatland vegetation.  
- Utilized UAV-based remote sensing to capture seasonal dynamics of wetland vegetation diversity in subalpine peatland environments.  

## Impact of Forest Structure and Traits on Carbon and Nitrogen Leaching Processes  
**2024.06 - Present**  
*Member*, National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program)  
- Investigating the effects of structural and trait differences in various forest community types on carbon and nitrogen downward leaching processes, utilizing field plot monitoring, LiDAR, UAV hyperspectral technology, and laboratory analysis.  
- Exploring multi-interface regulatory mechanisms of forest structure and traits on carbon and nitrogen leaching processes in ecological restoration forests of the water source area of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project.
