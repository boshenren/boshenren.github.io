I'm a third-year master's student in Global Change Ecology, specializing in Vegetation Remote Sensing. I'm jointly trained by [Tibet University](https://www.utibet.edu.cn/) and [Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.wbgcas.cn/).<br>
Advisor: Assoc. Prof. [Qinghu Jiang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0070769)



🌍 The escalating global biodiversity and climate crises demand urgent action in ecosystem protection, restoration, and management.

🔬 My research combines field survey data with multi-source remote sensing data, particularly hyperspectral remote sensing technology, to explore the adaptive and responsive mechanisms of plant functional traits to environmental changes. By integrating hyperspectral remote sensing and field observation data, I conduct an in-depth analysis of plant community structure and diversity, as well as investigate their interactions with ecosystem functions. The goal of my research is to enhance our understanding and quantitative analysis of complex ecological processes through the integration of multidimensional data.
