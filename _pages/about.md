I'm a third-year master's student in Global Change Ecology, specializing in Vegetation Remote Sensing. I'm jointly trained by [Tibet University](https://www.utibet.edu.cn/) and [Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.wbgcas.cn/).<br>
Advisor: Assoc. Prof. [Qinghu Jiang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0070769)

The escalating global biodiversity and climate crises demand urgent action in ecosystem protection, restoration, and management. Traditional field research alone cannot keep pace with the rapid and widespread changes occurring in our ecosystems. Remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral technology, offers a powerful solution for frequent and continuous monitoring of ecosystems and their biodiversity across vast areas.

My research harnesses the potential of multi-scale hyperspectral remote sensing to advance our understanding of plant diversity, functional traits, and ecosystem dynamics from a spectral perspective. By leveraging near-ground UAV-based hyperspectral imaging and plant spectroscopy , we aim to develop innovative methods for remote biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem assessment.
